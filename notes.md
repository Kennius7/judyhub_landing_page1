1. Client clicks on cart icon on the product item to go to product description and add to cart modal
2. Client clicks on checkout button to go to checkout page
3. Include name/email in a pre-filled message
4. On shared/public PCs, encourage users to confirm they are logged into their WhatsApp before clicking
5. Client clicks on image to magnify it in a modal
6. Client clicks on the cart icon on the navbar to go to general cart modal
7. Make the cart icon on the navbar show the number of products in the cart
